# Hybrid Energy System Optimization
 Optimization of a hybrid solar/wind/hydroelectric pumped storage system in Egypt using metaheuristics (SA, GA, PSO, FA).  Neural networks were trained to approximate objective functions, enabling faster evaluations and reducing computational time as population size increased.
